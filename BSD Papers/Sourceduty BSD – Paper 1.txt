Abstract:

This paper presents the first phase of Sourceduty’s computational modeling and symbolic logic framework applied to the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer (BSD) Conjecture. We propose a hybrid methodology combining high-performance numerical computation with formal logic systems to operationalize key conjectural components—specifically, elliptic curve rank estimations and L-function evaluations. Utilizing frameworks developed in-house, such as TolSum, DistRed, and Truthvar, our approach aims to transform abstract mathematical objects into programmable, traceable, and evaluable entities within Python ecosystems.

1. Introduction:

The BSD Conjecture remains one of the most profound unsolved problems in mathematics, relating the number of rational points on an elliptic curve to the behavior of its L-function at s = 1. Our objective is not to prove or disprove the conjecture directly, but to computationally structure its fundamental mechanics using tools from symbolic AI, algorithmic optimization, and modular logic design.

This paper inaugurates a multi-part research series from Sourceduty, focusing on the translation of abstract mathematics into digital systems amenable to logic verification and numerical validation.

2. Methodology:

2.1. Algorithmic Acceleration (TolSum + DistRed)

Sourceduty modeled key computations—such as point enumeration, L-function sampling, and curve invariant evaluations—through NumPy, SciPy, and Numba. TolSum was used to manage floating-point tolerances in critical computations, while DistRed enabled stochastic simplification of symbolic expressions during function evaluations.

2.2. Symbolic Logic Integration (Truthvar, ImpactQ)

To encode conjectural logic such as "rank equals order of vanishing," Sourceduty built evolving truth-state machines with probabilistic truth propagation. Z3 and PyDatalog were embedded to explore predicate logic transformations, enabling rudimentary symbolic validation.

2.3. Modular Structuring (Comtag + Modbias)

All computational pathways were decorated with Comtag class annotations to ensure logical traceability. Modbias was applied to audit fairness in logic assumptions—particularly in curve selection heuristics and parameter settings.

3. Results:

Sourceduty successfully constructed a hybrid system capable of:

- Evaluating elliptic curve L-functions numerically under symbolic constraints.
- Wrapping BSD core routines in Numba-accelerated decorators.
- Expressing parts of the conjecture in symbolic predicate logic for compatibility with solvers like Z3.
- Structuring reusable modules with deterministic, observable tagging for research traceability.

4. Discussion:

This approach illustrates a new paradigm: treating abstract mathematical conjectures as dynamic, testable logic systems. While no direct proof or falsification was attempted, the modular groundwork laid here establishes a solid platform for future explorations—both numerical and symbolic—in the BSD domain.

5. Conclusion and Next Steps:

Future papers will delve deeper into:

- Quantum-symbolic simulations using Qiskit.
- Reinforcement learning for symbolic tuning of curve behaviors.
- Distributed benchmarking of BSD evaluators under varying field conditions.
