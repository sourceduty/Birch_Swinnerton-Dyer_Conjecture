The Sourceduty BSD Parsing Stack provides a layered computational framework that breaks down the most complex aspects of the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer (BSD) Conjecture into analyzable and simulatable components. This stack incorporates key modules like *Infinity Control*, *Quadexpo*, *ImpactQ*, *Factorchain*, *Truthvar*, and others, allowing us to explore infinite-dimensional arithmetic objects through constrained, functional approximations. For instance, we apply *Infinity Control* to the Selmer group and Tate–Shafarevich group to identify whether their growth remains within bounds under various extensions of \(\mathbb{Q}\). Using the *Quadexpo* module, we model Selmer group growth as quadratic or exponential and examine how this behavior affects the broader consistency of the conjecture. We also simulate higher-order derivatives of toy L-functions to explore analytic rank approximations under the *ImpactQ* model, allowing us to interpret the effect of derivative behavior on BSD predictions when direct evaluation of \( L^{(r)}(E, 1) \) is computationally infeasible.

In this simulation, a known elliptic curve (Cremona label 11a1) served as a case study due to its well-understood properties: rank 0, finite torsion, and a finite Tate–Shafarevich group. Applying the full Sourceduty stack to this curve revealed stable behavior across all modules. The Selmer group showed bounded growth, as confirmed by the Infinity Control filter, while the derivative signal chain under *ImpactQ* yielded a smooth decay of normalized derivative magnitudes—signifying that the analytic function remains well-behaved at \( s = 1 \). Additionally, *Factorchain* analysis confirmed the Galois structure of the torsion subgroup was flat and rational, introducing no deeper cohomological complexity. These results, plotted and exported, offer a visual and quantitative grounding for the BSD components that are often discussed only in theory. The Truthvar module confirmed that this curve lies in a domain where the BSD conjecture has been rigorously verified, thus providing a benchmark for interpreting the behavior of more complex cases.

The larger goal of the Sourceduty stack is to generalize this level of control and insight across arbitrary elliptic curves, especially those with unknown rank or where the finiteness of \( \Sha \) is conjectural. By dissecting curves into bounded functional sequences, we gain new tools for partial proofs, statistical modeling of BSD truth zones, and even predictive classification of elliptic curves by behavior type. For more difficult problems—like establishing the finiteness of \( \Sha \) across infinite towers or analyzing curves with high conductor and suspected large rank—the stack provides the scaffolding to approach them with precision logic. It bridges analytic and algebraic domains using regulated, structured pathways. The outputs of this simulation, now compiled into a zipped dataset of CSVs and plots, form a prototype for how BSD conjecture components can be systematically decomposed and studied in real or hypothetical scenarios. This process ultimately aims to support conditional verification frameworks and functional simulations that approach a full resolution of BSD from the bottom up.
