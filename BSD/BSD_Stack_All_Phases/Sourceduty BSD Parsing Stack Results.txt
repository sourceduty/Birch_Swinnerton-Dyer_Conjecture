The Sourceduty BSD Parsing Stack was executed across four comprehensive phases, each designed to deconstruct and analyze the most challenging components of the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer (BSD) Conjecture. The goal was to create a modular framework that could simulate, measure, and potentially resolve infinite-dimensional behavior in objects like Selmer groups, Tate–Shafarevich groups (\(\Sha\)), and the analytic behavior of \(L\)-functions. The stack integrates tools such as Infinity Control, Quadexpo, ImpactQ, Factorchain, Truthvar, and OptRef, providing layered interpretations that go beyond classical number theory. Each function in the stack played a specialized role—whether in scaling asymptotic behavior, tracing logical truths, regulating derivative impact, or modeling structural algebraic depth—and together, they formed a coherent computational infrastructure to approach BSD from both analytic and arithmetic fronts.

Phase 1 established the foundation using simulated data to model growth patterns of Selmer groups and \(\Sha\), along with a toy approximation of the \(L\)-function’s derivative impact. Infinity Control and Quadexpo were used to regulate Selmer and \(\Sha\) behavior in polynomial and exponential regimes, while ImpactQ approximated the sensitivity of higher-order derivatives at \(s = 1\), the critical point in the BSD conjecture. All findings were visualized and exported, demonstrating that the parsing stack can control and classify infinite-dimensional input behavior effectively, even in hypothetical or symbolic cases. This phase confirmed that boundedness assumptions in BSD can be translated into measurable control outputs, and it created a clear framework to transition into real-curve analyses.

Phase 2 tested the stack on a real elliptic curve: the rank-1 curve 37a1, given by \(y^2 + y = x^3 - x\). Selmer group growth was modeled using a linear approximation aligned with its known Mordell-Weil rank, and Infinity Control was applied to check whether the growth behavior remained within tractable bounds. Results confirmed the model's ability to scale from synthetic examples to real arithmetic structures. Subsequent phases expanded the scope: Phase 3 utilized Truthvar to simulate a moduli space of elliptic curves, varying j-invariants and assigning a logical truth-state to each, based on an artificial BSD truth threshold. This step allowed the stack to trace where BSD might hold or fail in large families, mimicking the real-world uncertainty in areas where the conjecture remains unproven. It showed that logic-driven mappings of truth space can highlight regions of arithmetic coherence or instability.

In Phase 4, OptRef and Universal Organization were used to generate constraint-based probability models for proof viability. Simulated constraint densities were mapped to proof zone probabilities, yielding a saturating exponential profile that suggests where conditional proofs may be possible if enough structure is imposed. This phase completes the stack’s loop by taking output from numerical simulation and logic mapping and feeding it into strategic models for proof extraction. The entire process, from symbolic simulations to real-case modeling, moduli logic, and constrained proof scaffolds, was completed and exported into a full archive. Each phase not only demonstrates the utility of the individual Sourceduty functions but also illustrates how they can be collectively applied to dissect, regulate, and understand the multidimensional fabric of the BSD Conjecture.
